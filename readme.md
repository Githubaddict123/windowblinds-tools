Welcome to a practical toolkit for Windows skinning. WindowBlinds Tools is a modular system that helps you skin the user interface. It focuses on a fast skinning engine, theme packs, Start Menu styles, and blur effects. The project aims for stability, accessibility, and an approachable workflow for designers and developers.

- ðŸŽ¨ Skinning engine that adapts to system visuals
- ðŸ§° Theme packs that change colors, textures, and effects
- ðŸªŸ Start Menu styles that fit modern and classic looks
- ðŸ”Ž Blur and glass effects for depth and clarity
- ðŸ§­ Clear guidelines for creating, testing, and sharing themes

This repository brings together the core pieces you need to customize Windows visuals in a coherent and repeatable way. It is built with an emphasis on simplicity, reliability, and a developer-friendly API. Whether you want a subtle system-wide theme or bold, high-contrast skins, youâ€™ll find a solid foundation here.

Overview and goals
- Provide a robust skinning engine that runs efficiently on a wide range of hardware.
- Support a diverse set of theme packs that can be loaded, previewed, and swapped at runtime.
- Offer Start Menu styling options that coexist with native Windows behavior.
- Expose an accessible API so designers can build their own skins without digging into low-level rendering code.
- Ensure themes are portable, versioned, and easy to distribute through a releases page.
- Maintain a clear, documented flow for contributors and theme creators.

Key concepts
- Skinning engine: The runtime core that applies skins to UI elements. It handles rendering, layering, and resource management.
- Theme pack: A collection of assets and metadata that define a skin. A pack may include images, color schemes, fonts, and rules for rendering.
- Start Menu style: A set of rules and assets that shape the appearance and behavior of the Start Menu area.
- Blur and glass: Visual effects that simulate depth and focus. The engine optimizes rendering to minimize impact on frame rates.
- Manifest: A small descriptor that defines a theme pack, its version, dependencies, and compatibility notes.
- Preview mode: A lightweight mode to visualize a theme before full application of changes.

What you can do with WindowBlinds Tools
- Create a custom theme pack that changes window borders, title bars, taskbar accents, and control colors.
- Swap Start Menu visuals to align with a chosen theme or branding.
- Apply blur and glass effects to windows and panels for a modern appearance.
- Build theme presets for light and dark modes, high contrast themes, or themed productivity dashboards.
- Package and publish your skins for others to download from the releases section.

Getting started
Prerequisites
- A supported Windows version with the required subsystem loaded.
- Administrative access to install skin packs and to apply system-wide themes.
- A stable graphics driver with up-to-date support for visual effects.
- An understanding of basic theming concepts: assets, colors, typography, and rendering order.

Step-by-step setup
1) Obtain the latest package from the releases page.
2) Run the installer or unzip the theme pack as instructed in the package notes.
3) Open the Theme Manager and select the skin you want to apply.
4) Review the preview, then apply the theme. If prompted, allow the engine to adjust transparency and blur settings.
5) Reboot or log off and on if required by the theme for full activation.

Walkthrough example
- Install a dark glass theme.
- Enable blur on title bars and panels for depth.
- Apply a Start Menu style that matches the overall theme.
- Save the configuration as a personal preset.
- Switch presets quickly from the Theme Manager.

Architectural overview
- Core engine: The central runtime that orchestrates rendering, resource loading, and theme application.
- Theme loader: Reads manifest files, resolves assets, and validates compatibility.
- Rendering layer: Applies effects and paints UI elements with proper layering.
- Input and events: Listens for system changes that require a skin refresh, such as color profile updates or high-contrast mode toggles.
- Start Menu handler: Applies styles to the Start Menu region while preserving essential Windows behavior.
- Accessibility adapter: Ensures high contrast and scalable UI where possible.

Design principles
- Modularity: Each part of the system has a clear responsibility, making it easier to add new skins without touching core code.
- Safety: The engine validates theme packs to avoid conflicts with system components.
- Performance: Rendering paths are optimized with sensible defaults and options to disable expensive effects.
- Compatibility: The system aims to work with a broad set of Windows builds and GPU configurations.
- Extensibility: There are defined extension points for plugins and themes to integrate cleanly.

Theme system in detail
Theme packs
- Metadata: Each pack includes a manifest.json with name, version, author, and compatibility notes.
- Assets: Images, textures, and font assets are organized in a predictable folder structure.
- Rules: Rendering rules define how colors, borders, and textures apply to different UI elements.
- Resources: Local resources reduce dependency on network access and improve reliability.

Manifest example
{
  "name": "Aurora Dark Glass",
  "version": "1.2.0",
  "author": "YourName",
  "preview": "assets/preview.png",
  "compatibility": {
    "windows": "10+",
    "gpu": "NVIDIA/AMD/Intel with DX12 support"
  },
  "dependencies": {
    "core": ">=2.1.0"
  },
  "themes": {
    "global": {
      "colors": {
        "primary": "#4e6fff",
        "secondary": "#1e1e1e"
      },
      "gloss": 0.12,
      "blur": 0.6
    },
    "startMenu": {
      "style": "darkGlass",
      "layout": "compact"
    }
  }
}

Creating a theme pack
- Plan a visual direction: start with a mood, then pick a color palette and texture set.
- Define UI scopes: decide which parts of the UI you skin (title bars, borders, menus, panels, taskbar).
- Prepare assets: gather icons, textures, and fonts that fit your palette.
- Write manifest: include necessary metadata and compatibility notes.
- Build rules: describe how assets apply to each UI element and define any dynamic behavior (like hover states).
- Test thoroughly: verify on both light and dark modes; test high contrast scenarios.
- Package: compress the skin with its manifest and assets for distribution.

Start Menu styling
- Styles available: classic, modern, glass, compact, and pane-based layouts.
- Behavior: a Start Menu style should not disrupt essential Windows functions like searching, app launching, or notifications.
- Themes and focus: ensure text is legible on every background, especially when blur is enabled.
- Accessibility: provide high-contrast variants and scalable fonts.

Blur effects and depth
- Blur levels: low, medium, high. Each setting adjusts the blur radius and performance cost.
- Glass effect: uses translucency and texture overlays to simulate glass panels.
- Performance trade-offs: blur can be GPU-intensive; prefer a toggle to disable on lower-end machines.
- Accessibility: blur intensity should be adjustable to assist readability and reduce motion discomfort.

Theme creation workflow
- Step 1: Define the aesthetic goal and user needs.
- Step 2: Build a color palette with primary, secondary, and neutral colors.
- Step 3: Create textures and textures variants for light and dark contexts.
- Step 4: Write the manifest with compatibility and dependency data.
- Step 5: Implement UI rules for each element you skin.
- Step 6: Run live previews and adjust as needed.
- Step 7: Package and publish to releases.

API and extension points
- Core API: A stable set of functions to apply themes, load packs, and query state.
- Event hooks: Receive notifications when a theme loads, when a region redraws, or when blur settings change.
- Theme loader: A module to read manifest files and manage asset resolution.
- Plugin interface: A small API for third-party developers to add new skin features without breaking existing skins.
- Scripting support: Optional scripting hooks to automate changes, like applying a theme at startup or on workload shifts.

Code snippets (conceptual)
- Loading a theme package:
  loadTheme("Aurora Dark Glass");
- Applying a blur level:
  setBlur(0.6);

- Registering a Start Menu style:
  registerStartMenuStyle("darkGlass");

- Listening for theme changes:
  onThemeChanged((theme) => {
    refreshUI(theme);
  });

Packaging and distribution
- Package layout: Each theme pack is a folder with a manifest.json, assets/, and docs/.
- Versioning: Use semantic versioning for theme packs to track compatibility and changes.
- Integrity: Include checksums for assets to ensure integrity after download.
- Distribution: Host on the releases page; provide clear install instructions in the package notes.
- Update flow: When a theme is updated, users should receive a notification and an easy path to upgrade.

Installing from the releases page
- Download the installer or theme pack.
- Run the installer or unzip the package to a local directory.
- Open the Theme Manager and load the theme pack.
- Apply and verify appearance. Save as a preset if desired.
- If the theme requests a reboot or sign-in refresh, perform the steps as prompted.

Performance and testing
- Benchmark scenarios: measure load times for themes, blur initialization, and Start Menu rendering.
- GPU considerations: test across a range of GPUs to ensure stable rendering.
- Memory usage: monitor memory to avoid leaks when switching between skins.
- Accessibility tests: verify legibility under various color contrasts and text sizes.
- Stress tests: apply multiple skins in sequence to test unloading and reloading paths.

Accessibility and inclusivity
- High contrast skins: ensure sufficient contrast for critical UI components.
- Text sizing: support user scaling without layout breakage.
- Keyboard navigation: keep focus indicators visible and consistent across themes.
- Screen reader hints: ensure labels and tooltips remain readable with themes applied.

Localization and language support
- Localize labels, menu items, and help text in manifest files.
- Provide locale-specific assets if needed for icons or textures.
- Test right-to-left (RTL) layouts if supported, ensuring alignment and padding are preserved.

Networking, data, and privacy
- Theme data handling: store user preferences locally and minimize network requests.
- Telemetry: if included, keep it opt-in and with clear in-app consent prompts.
- Updates: fetch releases and assets from the official releases page; avoid forced background downloads.

Troubleshooting
- If a theme fails to apply, check compatibility notes in the manifest.
- If blur looks off, try lowering the blur level or disabling it to verify rendering paths.
- If Start Menu styles misalign, verify the style hook and layout configuration.
- If assets fail to load, confirm asset paths and permission settings.
- For persistent issues, revert to a stable default theme and reapply one pack at a time.
